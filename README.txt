Introduction
============
Due to the fact that the company who has startet Visual AJAX GUI Builder, Sigmasoft, did make it closed source and seemingly has stopped further development, we have started forking the last acceptable LGPL licensed version, which is Sigma Visual Builder 2.0.2, and relabled it under the name "Ajax Web Developer".

Compiling:
============
Start build_visualjs.bat to compile everything. Project will be saved to \build\<version>\ and can be started by opening index.html in your favourite webbrowser.

Further Development:
====================
-adding project support 
-adding code completion
-creating documentation w/ tutorials

Version History:
===============
v1.0 - Repack of Sigma Visual AJAX GUI Builder
