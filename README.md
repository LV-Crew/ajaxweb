Introduction
============
Due to the fact that the company who has startet Visual AJAX GUI Builder, Sigmasoft, did make it closed source and seemingly has stopped further development, we have started forking the last acceptable LGPL licensed version, which is Sigma Visual Builder 2.0.2, and relabled it under the name "Ajax Web Developer".<br>
It is a full featured WYSIWYG JavaScript editor/code generator.<br>
ZIP.exe from http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/zip.htm is being used.

Requirements
============
To Build: Java SDK 8.0+<br>
To Run: Mozilla Firefox<br>

Known Issues
============
-File has to opened manually, "Start Project" is not yet implemented<br>
-Loading of files is not yet implemented<br>
-Upload to server is not yet implemented<br>

Compiling:
============
Start build_visualjs.bat to compile everything. Project will be saved to \build\<version>\ and can be started by opening index.html in your favourite webbrowser.

Further Development:
====================
-adding project support<br> 
-adding code completion<br>
-creating documentation w/ tutorials
